# Mandala Feasibility Exploration

This project purpose is to explore how feasible is to create Mandalas using the fact that any periodic function can be approximated via an infinite sum of simple sines and cosines waves. Conversely any finite sum of simple sines and cosines is periodic. This is the fact that it is used to construct periodic shapes and make radial plots of it. 

## Installation

1. Download the folder
2. Unzip it
3. Open the jupyter notebook (from terminal cd into the folder and run "jupyter notebook")

## Usage

Run over and over to get different shapes. Change the random function. Explore.
